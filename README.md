## Your Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story

As an on the go traveler I want to check the weather in various locations,


## Criteria


GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
